    "text": "Forecasting electricity demand is an extremely relevant problem for energy providers, as it influences not only the cost of day to day operations but also the timeliness and effectiveness of preparing for extreme weather conditions. Additionally, providers have to account for variations in geographic locations, further increasing the complexity of forecasting tasks.\nIn this blog post, I aim to explore the applications and performance of several forecasting methods for this task. I’m specifically using the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market dataset, which features the electricity price and demand of New South Wales and Victoria, as well as the amount transferred between the two states."
