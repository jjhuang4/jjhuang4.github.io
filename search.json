    "text": "Forecasting electricity demand is an extremely relevant problem for energy providers, as it influences not only the cost of day to day operations but also the timeliness and effectiveness of preparing for extreme weather conditions. Additionally, providers have to account for variations in geographic locations, further increasing the complexity of forecasting tasks.\nIn this blog post, I aim to explore the applications and performance of several forecasting methods for this task. I’m specifically using the Australian New South Wales Electricity Market dataset, which features the electricity price and demand of New South Wales and Victoria, as well as the amount transferred between the two states.\nThe data contains 45,312 instances for the days from May 7, 1996 to December 5, 1998, with observations recorded every half hour in each 24 hour period. I account for this granularity in my approach.\n\nelectricity.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndate\nday\nperiod\nnswprice\nnswdemand\nvicprice\nvicdemand\ntransfer\nclass\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.0\n2\n0.000000\n0.056443\n0.439155\n0.003467\n0.422915\n0.414912\nUP\n\n\n1\n0.0\n2\n0.021277\n0.051699\n0.415055\n0.003467\n0.422915\n0.414912\nUP\n\n\n2\n0.0\n2\n0.042553\n0.051489\n0.385004\n0.003467\n0.422915\n0.414912\nUP\n\n\n3\n0.0\n2\n0.063830\n0.045485\n0.314639\n0.003467\n0.422915\n0.414912\nUP\n\n\n4\n0.0\n2\n0.085106\n0.042482\n0.251116\n0.003467\n0.422915\n0.414912\nDOWN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data has a very fine level of granularity, making for a highly dense time series plot for the entire series. Right off the bat we can observe a longer term seasonality in the trend line of the graph.\n\nfig, ax = plot_series(electricity['nswdemand'])\nfig, ax = plot_series(electricity['nswprice'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting a couple smaller length sections of the series (in intervals of 1000 observations) lets us see smaller scale seasonalities, which are immediately discernable.\n\nfig, ax = plot_series(electricity['nswdemand'][0:1000])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfig, ax = plot_series(electricity['nswdemand'][20000:21000])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe magnitude of seasonal variations doesn’t appear to be influenced by the length of the time series, so I assume an additive decomposition to be the most appropriate such that\n\\(y_t = S_t + T_t + R_t\\)\nwhere data is decomposed into seasonal, trend, and remainder components respectively.\nThis data doesn’t contain any missing values:\n\n# Checking for missing values\nmissing_values = electricity.isna().sum()\nprint(missing_values)\n\ndate         0\nday          0\nperiod       0\nnswprice     0\nnswdemand    0\nvicprice     0\nvicdemand    0\ntransfer     0\nclass        0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nNow let’s perform an STL decomposition to get an idea of the seasonal and trend-cycle components of our data.\n\nstl = STLTransformer(return_components=True)\ny_stl = stl.fit_transform(electricity['nswdemand'])\nplot_series(y_stl['transformed'][0:1000])\nplot_series(y_stl['seasonal'][0:1000])\nplot_series(y_stl['trend'][0:1000])\nplot_series(y_stl['resid'][0:1000])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nplot_correlations(electricity['nswdemand'][0:1000])\n\n(&lt;Figure size 1200x800 with 3 Axes&gt;,\n array([&lt;Axes: ylabel='nswdemand'&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'Autocorrelation'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'Partial Autocorrelation'}&gt;], dtype=object))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA closer look at the daily seasonality present in the data:\n\nplot_correlations(electricity['nswdemand'][0:96])\nplot_correlations(electricity['nswdemand'][0:48])\n\n(&lt;Figure size 1200x800 with 3 Axes&gt;,\n array([&lt;Axes: ylabel='nswdemand'&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'Autocorrelation'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'Partial Autocorrelation'}&gt;], dtype=object))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProphet is a model developed by Facebook for use in commercial forecasting applications; it has strong out of the box performance in data containing multiple seasonalities and holiday effects. I use a downgraded 1.1.5 version of Prophet due to optimization errors that arise with the 1.1.6 version.\n\ny = electricity['nswdemand']\ny_train, y_test = temporal_train_test_split(y, test_size=0.2)\nforecaster = Prophet(\n    seasonality_mode='additive',\n    add_country_holidays={'country_name': 'Australia'},\n    yearly_seasonality=True,\n    weekly_seasonality=True,\n    daily_seasonality=True\n)\nforecaster.fit(y_train)\n\n20:30:44 - cmdstanpy - INFO - Chain [1] start processing\n20:31:09 - cmdstanpy - INFO - Chain [1] done processing\n\n\nProphet(add_country_holidays={'country_name': 'Australia'},\n        daily_seasonality=True, weekly_seasonality=True,\n        yearly_seasonality=True)Please rerun this cell to show the HTML repr or trust the notebook.Prophet?Documentation for ProphetProphet(add_country_holidays={'country_name': 'Australia'},\n        daily_seasonality=True, weekly_seasonality=True,\n        yearly_seasonality=True)\n\n\n\n# Specify forecasting horizon and pass on to forecasting algorithm\ny_pred = forecaster.predict(np.arange(len(y_test)))\nmape = mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_test, y_pred)\nmae = mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred)\nmse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)\nprint(f\"MAPE: {mape} \\nMAE: {mae} \\nMSE: {mse}\")\n\nMAPE: 0.4249256440189072 \nMAE: 0.137539113940522 \nMSE: 0.02971161186595875\n\n\n\nfig, ax = plot_series(y_test[0:1000], y_pred[0:1000], labels=[\"y_test\", \"y_pred\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is obviously very wrong. Will be back with further updates down to line to further explore."
